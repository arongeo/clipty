# clipty - macOS clipboard history tool

## CAREFUL DON'T USE IT UNLESS YOU USE ICLOUD KEYCHAIN FOR PASSWORD MANAGEMENT, OTHERWISE IT WILL STORE YOU PASSWORD PLAINTEXT!
You can add you password manager's bundle ID to the blacklistedBundleIDs in ClipboardHandler.swift, that way it won't save or show it.
